# Chapter 6 – Oneiros

Clementine held her breath upon entering the portal.

The four emerged into a hallway. Caltrops were scattered over the ground, some of them stained with blood. Pipes crawled in and out of the ceiling like roots. Glowing tendril-like protrusions bathed the hallway in pale blue light. Sparks of electricity hissed and flashed from the ceiling. The low drone of running machinery haunted them in every direction. The scent of iron clung to the air.

Neko had spread himself sideways on Solana’s back, grooming his face. Clementine shuddered and huddled against Solana, her breath swirling before her.

Armin’s eyes narrowed at the bloodstains. He whispered, “So this is the world you found, huh?” His voice echoed down the corridor. He slowly fanned his tails out and closed his eyes. “It’s quiet.”

Solana nodded. She then summoned a wisp of flame, banishing the darkness with its warm glow. She pointed forward. “This way. And take caution where you walk.”

Armin glanced down. Looking at the caltrops scattered around the floor, he glazed ice over them and swept them away to the corners. “Anything else?”

“Oh yeah,” Neko said, “Don’t walk on the tiles with rounded corners.”

At the end of the hall was a door. It was composed of thick metal all around, and large enough for two people to pass through at once. There was a small monitor and keyboard adjacent to the door here, and it seemed to be connected to a locking mechanism. The handle had barbed wire coiled around it. Electricity sang through the air. The smell of smoke wafted faintly past it.

Clementine’s eyes circled the area. “Wow. Whatever is behind this door, Vicerre really doesn’t want us going in there.”

She approached the monitor, and it flickered on. The following text rolled across the screen:

    > [PROJECT ONEIROS]
    > Password: █

Armin peered over and tilted his head.

Clementine thought for a bit, then started punching in letters.

    > [PROJECT ONEIROS]
    > Password: password
    > Wrong password.

    > [PROJECT ONEIROS]
    > Password: 123456
    > Wrong password.

    > [PROJECT ONEIROS]
    > Password: oneiros
    > Wrong password.

    > [PROJECT ONEIROS]
    > Password: vichere
    > Wrong password.

    > [PROJECT ONEIROS]
    > Password: admin
    > Unlocked.

A light on the monitor turned green, and a click could be heard from the other side of the door.

“Nice guess!” Neko cheered.

“Interesting,” Solana remarked.

Clementine frowned in confusion. “That can’t be it… can it?”

The terminal flickered, and a new set of text appeared on the screen.

    > 200x-03-10.log
    > 200x-03-14.log
    > 200x-03-15.log
    …
    > 201x-11-03.log
    > 201x-11-04.log
    > oneiros.txt

Clementine selected and opened the file named “oneiros.txt”.

    > Applications for selective targeting of acetylcholine receptors in the CNS
    >
    > A. Vicerre
    >
    > ABSTRACT
    > [Next...]

Clementine tapped a button, and a long stream of text printed across the screen.

Neko hopped up on Clementine’s shoulder and looked at the new paragraph. “This is a clue, right?”

He tilted his head. “Ah, erm… hmm.” His ears perked, and his tail sprung. “I know the words ‘sleep’… and ‘study’… and ‘nervous’.”

Clementine scanned through the next paragraph. She murmured, “I think this is a research paper on how Oneiros works. There’s got to be useful information in here somewhere, right?”

She paused, then reread the first line a second time. She squinted, then reread it a third time. None of the words she read registered in her mind. She scratched her head.

Armin stared at the screen and ran his eyes over the abstract. “I think I could help. Judging by the first paragraph alone, I believe the reference to ‘REM sleep’ correlates to dreamwalking, and the reference to ‘neuromuscular junctions’ correlates to enthralling.”

Clementine blinked at Armin, then shuffled over to give him a better view of the screen. She then started scrolling.

Solana looked at Armin in curiosity.

Several minutes later, Armin’s ears perked. “Stop,” he said. He went silent, and his eyes gleaned over the terminal. As his eyes scanned the screen, he nodded his head in slow but sure understanding.

A few moments later, he said, “I got it. I think.”

“Basically,” he continued, “there’s a vulnerability in the system he’s using. It appears as though we can disrupt the system and escape if we can—let’s see here—‘breach the connection point the administrator used to initialize the shared instance’.”

“Huh, nice find!” Neko said. He paused. “…So, uhm, what does that mean?”

He replied, “The ‘connection point’ must refer to the nexus between the Physical and Mental Planes.” Looking at Clementine, he added, “That’s where you originally fell from the sky.”

Turning towards Solana, he continued, “And we can infer that the administrator is likely Vicerre. Under that assumption, if we can find his nexus point, we should be set. Luckily for us, we’re already in his Headscape.”

He grew a filament of ice from the ground to the now-unlocked door handle, hooked it around the other side, then pulled. He then pushed the door open.

“In that case,” he said, “I believe we just need to traverse the innards of his Headscape until we find it.”

“Wow,” Clementine blinked. “That’s some nice deduction.” She looked around. “I guess that explains why this Headscape is so hostile and confusing.”

Armin looked at Clementine warmly.

She then looked at the next set of corridors. The architecture was hardly different. Between the dim lights, exposed infrastructure, circuitry, and unnatural chill, they might as well not have moved.

She noted a few small differences, however. A draft was blowing in from somewhere, and one edge of the corridor had a cobweb. Part of the floor sat askew as if it were resting on the side of a hill. Down the hallway were additional hallways intersecting at odd angles, with the occasional door branching off of them. Traversing the next area wouldn’t be straightforward.

Looking at Armin, she said, “I’m sorry to ask more from you—” Armin waved his tails dismissively “—but could you mark the area with ice every time we come across a fork in the path? We should be able to find everything in here if we just keep track of how many times we’ve been through each corridor.”

Armin nodded. At the first entryway, he erected a crystalline spire.

“Right then,” he said. “Shall we carry on?”

---

They had spent what seemed like an hour passing from door to door and corridor to corridor. Clementine had started wondering how large and detailed Headscapes could be.

“Oh,” Armin muttered.

He came to a standstill after walking through the next door. He turned around and examined the door frame.

“What is it?” Clementine asked.

Armin walked forward and back through the door. “The location of the nexus point changes depending on what side of the door I’m on. On this side, I estimate we’re several hundred meters away, while on the other side, we’re several hundred meters away… in the opposite direction.”

“Like you teleported!” Neko said.

“Effectively.”

Clementine pressed a few fingers against her cheek and groaned. “That just makes navigating the maze more confusing.”

“I suppose we shouldn’t be surprised,” Armin said. “If anything, though, I see this discovery as a positive.”

“Why is that?” asked Solana.

“This area tells us that Vicerre’s Headspace is designed in a way that defies the traditional laws of physics. In that case, we should consider thinking about this area in a way beyond a traditional maze.”

“That must apply to the nexus point,” Solana said.

Armin nodded. “Even if we seem far, It could mean that we may teleport directly in front of the nexus point with enough time.”

“I guess that could happen,” Clementine muttered.

Armin noticed the lukewarm tone of her voice. “You don’t seem convinced.”

“Well,” she replied, “judging by my sole encounter with him, he doesn’t seem like the sort of person to leave things up to chance.”

She scrunched her brows and glanced at the ground. “What if this place is all a bluff? What if you’re meant to reach the nexus point by a completely different means?”

“Counterpoint,” Armin replied. “Why would his Headscape take on this shape at all if there wasn’t something at the end of it? Perhaps not the nexus point itself, but something else of value?”

Clementine looked down and thought for a while.

Armin stared at the end of the hallway and rolled his tails. “How about this?” he said. “All of you take a break and head back to the entrance. Warm up, get some snacks, play a few games. I can continue traversing this place by myself, and I’ll tell you if I find something interesting.”

Neko’s ears and tails perked, and he looked at Clementine.

Solana looked at Armin curiously. “Now, why would we do that?”

Clementine nodded in agreement. “I don’t mind taking a break from this…” She shook her head at him. “But there’s no way I’m leaving you in there by yourself!”

Armin flinched and looked aside. His tails rolled. “Clem, out of all of us, I’m the one with the most experience in traversing Headscapes. I’m also the one with the most appropriate set of abilities for traversing this Headscape in particular, especially with the reconnaissance Solana and Neko have given us already.”

His facial features relaxed, and he looked brightly at her. “I’ll be fine.”

Clementine became silent for a moment, then sighed sharply. “…You know you’re tempting fate by saying that, right?”

“I know,” he said, his tone meek and kind.

She then stepped towards him and pulled him into a deep hug. Then, she let him go.

“Good luck with your exploration.”
