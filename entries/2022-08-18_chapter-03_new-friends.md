# Chapter 3 – New Friends

First, it was pinpricks. Her fingers and toes felt as though she were being stung by a thousand bees, and her skin felt as if it were on fire.

With an arm outstretched, Clementine advanced towards Vicerre. Then, her ankle twisted, her legs gave, and she collapsed on the ground, crumpled. The world spun around her, and she was on the ceiling. The shock of her body hitting the ground didn’t feel too bad when a thousand pinpricks assaulted her at the same time.

The pinpricks then turned into locusts. Where they had stabbed at her before, they now consumed. Seconds ago, she could feel the grain of the floor against her skin, but there was nothing now. Every moment, Clementine urged herself to stand back up and face Vicerre, and every moment, her pleas were rebuffed.

Out of the corners of her eyes, black, spidery shapes skittered in. They teemed over each other, and as though it were a single-minded swarm, it ate away at her vision and burrowed into her mind.

Her head swam. She couldn’t stop her eyelids from twitching and fluttering, nor could she stop her next set of breaths from becoming shallow. Her remaining vision was failing her; the window, the table, the floor, and Vicerre’s shoes—all of them were melding into a single, muddy shape.

At last, the world became dark.

---

Clementine wasn’t sure how long it took for her to regain consciousness. The passage of time seemed to ebb and flow, seconds smearing into minutes, before collapsing back into seconds.

With what awareness she had gained, Clementine could tell that the wind was buffeting against her hair. She stretched her hand out, and the air hugged against her fingers. She slowly remembered that, before she fell unconscious, all she could feel were pinpricks. The wind here was comforting.

Her eyelids unfurled. For a second, Clementine thought the spiders were still in her eyes, as blotches of colors sped past her vision. One was a bright carmine, another, citrine, and another, azure. It was only when one of these blotches smacked her in the face and exploded into a fine mist did she realize that they were real.

Next was a fuzzy cloud the color of lavender. It quickly spread across her field of vision, stretching past the corners of her eyes. It was only when she noticed her shadow growing did she realize that the clouds weren’t the ones flying past.

Clementine crashed into the cloud face-down, causing it to stretch and spread out. Then, it clumped back together, returning to its resting shape.

The wind had stopped.

Clementine exhaled.

Gravity.

Her head was still groggy, but the impact helped her come to. After a few minutes, she felt like she could move.

First, she slowly and stiffly wiggled her fingers and toes. When the pinpricks didn’t resume, she moved them more liberally. Then, she rolled her wrists and ankles. Then, her shoulders and thighs. Finally, she sat up.

Clementine looked up. The sky resembled a watercolor canvas, with ripples of blue and yellow expanding over an otherwise ambient, hazy backdrop. Elongated splashes of paint-like blobs zealously smeared the air.

Clementine looked down. The cloud beneath her had served as the ground, soft and fluffy. When she pressed her hand against the cloud, it stirred in her presence and billowed. She pressed harder against the cloud, punching a hole through it to the other side, where she found more air. She quickly pulled her hand back.

She inspected herself. She was wearing a short-sleeved, cotton striped top, full-length jeans, socks, and running shoes. She found that strange, as the last time she checked, it was a cold November morning. The backpack she last had on was gone—and the knife too, for that matter. Her lips felt chapped, as though it had been minutes ago when she rushed headlong out to follow a certain enthralled kitsune.

Pursing her lips, Clementine pinched her cheek. Nothing happened.

She looked around. There were beautiful skies and massive plumes of clouds for days, yet it seemed quite desolate at the same time. She saw no indication of Solana nor Neko—or Vicerre, for that matter. She grimaced.

She had started to recline back onto the ground when, suddenly, a shape appeared in the corner of her eye. Clementine spun towards it, crossed her legs, and squinted.

As the shape paced towards her, Clementine could see it with more clarity. It had two pointy ears, a snout, four legs, and four furry tails. Its fur was snow-white. Her eyes widened. Clementine looked for its eyes and sighed in relief when she saw they were bright blue.

She extended a hand, palm forward. The kitsune approached her and stuck its nose against her palm. Its fur was cool to the touch. Clementine blinked. Her hand retracted.

“You’re not Solana, are you?”

The kitsune’s ears twitched. “Solana?” he said. His voice was light and reedy, quite different from Solana’s thick timbre. “I’m sorry to disappoint you, but I’m not familiar with that name.”

The kitsune sat down, fluffed his tails, and looked up. “Judging by how you fell from the sky, you’re from the Physical Plane, aren’t you?”

Clementine blinked. “The Physical Plane?” Solana had mentioned this term before. “If I came from the Physical Plane… then this must be the Mental Plane, right?”

The kitsune’s ears perked and his tails waved. “That’s correct,” he said. “You’re familiar with this place, in that case?”

Clementine smiled shyly. “Well, only a little.”

She waved her hands at the painterly sky. “In that case, this is supposed to be my head—right? I think Solana called this place a ‘Headscape’.”

The kitsune nodded. “Right you are.”

Clementine continued, “I know that kitsune are attuned with this place. They can guide and explore people’s dreams… but they can’t tamper with them directly.”

The kitsune nodded.

“So… why can I see you and talk with you now?”

The kitsune’s tails wagged gently. “You’re an astute one. This is a phenomenon that’s new to me. As far as I understand, dreamers are able to cross paths and interact with other dreamers.”

Lowering his head, he quietly murmured, “That’s not the only change to the Mental Plane, however.”

Clementine tilted her head and pressed her cheek.

”You didn’t choose to come here, did you?” he said.

Clementine nodded firmly, frowning. She asked, “How do I get out?”

The kitsune looked at Clementine. “Well, normally, I can do _this_—”

For a moment, Clementine felt a tingle throughout her body, as if something was nipping her skin and trying to pull her into the air. At the same time, it felt as though gravity had strengthened and was pulling her down. These feelings then subsided.

The kitsune’s ears drooped, and he sighed. “—But not with this phenomenon active.”

He slowly approached her, head down, tails low. “…I haven’t been able to return to the Physical Plane, either. I’m sorry to hear that you’re experiencing the same thing.”

Clementine quietly nodded. “Thanks,” she mumbled. “The same goes for you. I wish I could help.”

The kitsune looked back up, swiveled his ears forward, and scoured Clementine from head to toe. “Would you like to?” he said. “I’m quite interested in reversing this phenomenon, you know, and any information from those affected would help with reaching a solution.”

Clementine’s eyes widened, and she nodded.

She then narrowed her eyes, looked down and rubbed a finger against her chin. “If someone could tamper with people’s minds in the real world, could that affect their dreams?”

The kitsune’s tails twitched, and he leaned towards her, eyes wide. “Oh, this is quite interesting,” he said. “It sounds like you know something about the phenomenon’s cause?”

Clementine returned his gaze, blinking. “Actually, before I came here, Solana was acting strangely. Her eyes turned yellow, and she traveled to meet this person called Vicerre.”

The kitsune’s ears twitched.

Clementine pressed her palm against her cheek and sighed. “Well, right off the bat, he told me that he was responsible for enthralling Solana. Then he did the same thing to Neko, and then me.”

Her gaze lowered, and her shoulders deflated. “That’s how I ended up here, I think.”

The kitsune pondered to himself, and his tails rolled. “A human capable of bringing others under his thrall. That’s quite unusual, isn’t it? As far as I know, humans don’t have any innate abilities that can serve this purpose.”

He thought briefly, then looked up. “By any chance, did it seem like he could have used technology to serve a similar purpose?”

Clementine blinked repeatedly. “Actually, yeah,” she replied. “His place was filled with all sorts of devices.”

“Interesting,” he said. “In that case, this phenomenon could be caused by a human invention.” His tails perked. “I have an idea what to do with this information.”

Clementine’s lips parted in a slight smile. “That’s great!”

“Though, before we get there…” he added. “You said that Solana was enthralled as well, correct?”

Clementine nodded.

“If your friends are also under the same effects as us, then they should be in the Mental Plane as well.”

Clementine’s eyes slowly widened. “…Wait, that’s right,” she said. “And if dreamers can cross paths with other dreamers…”

The kitsune nodded. “Then we should be able to find them. You’ll have peace of mind, and with any luck, Solana may be able to provide more information.”

He waved his tails. “I can handle navigation.”

Clementine’s eyes lit up, and then she nodded and climbed onto her feet.

The kitsune exhaled. “Right, then.” He closed his eyes, fanned out his tails, and walked in a small circle around Clementine. Clementine felt strange, as though her very essence were being tugged.

“So we’re trying to find a kitsune connected to you…” he muttered. His tails undulated systematically—first slowly, then rapidly, then slowly again, as though he were attuning himself with the ambient, imperceptible aether that permeated the space. “…Which affinity is she?”

“Fire.”

One of the kitsune’s tails quivered like a divining rod. “This way.”

Clementine felt normal again.

A puff of mist appeared where the kitsune had pointed. From its small size, it grew until it reached Clementine’s height. Inside the frame was a different landscape, one with lush green terrain and clear blue skies.

Clementine approached the frame and stretched one hand out and into the frame. The air felt soft against her skin, and the sun felt pleasant.

“She’s in there?” she asked.

“Well, the shortest way to reach her location is to pass through this Headscape.”

She nodded. “Ah, okay.”

The kitsune stepped through the portal and then beckoned Clementine with a wave of his tails.

Following him, Clementine lifted a foot and placed it on the other side of the frame. Grass crumpled gently beneath her shoes. Slowly, she moved through the portal. Looking back, the portal framed the colorful, wispy clouds of her Headscape, as though it were a painting.

Once she had passed through the portal completely, the kitsune merrily waved his tails. “I never did introduce myself, did I?”

Clementine shook her head.

“The name is Armin. And you are…?”

“Clementine.”

“Clem-en-tine,” he repeated. “That’s a nice name. Well, Clementine, it’s a pleasure to meet you, and I hope we can resolve this situation together. Let’s get going.”
