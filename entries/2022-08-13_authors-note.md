# Author's Note

When I sat down at my desk on 2022-01-28, I had planned to jot down a summary of the events of _Spaghetti Ice_. The story behind my universe had evolved over several years, and I sought to pen it down at last, as both a reference for friends and a form of legacy for myself.

As I edited the outline for the story, an itch soon developed. If I had to edit the summary anyway, why shouldn’t I improve the narrative? It’s been nine-odd years since the original story began, so I’ve had nine years to advance how themes and tropes are told through the story.

Never did I think that this decision would spin off into a project spanning thousands of words and multiple months' worth of weeknights.

In the end, I’ve produced this… thing. This retelling that has since obtained its own identity. This plot I've since straightened out after running it through a fine-toothed comb and smoothing out the knots. This story that, all deviations aside, I still hold close to my heart.

As this story is predominantly a personal project, I’m confident that this story isn’t exactly a unique tale or a masterpiece of literature. However, I encourage readers to explore the story with an open mind and a hunger for answers.

Regardless of its purpose, I give my thanks to each person who has supported it thus far. Thank you to the people who have shown support in its development, thank you to the people who have alpha- and beta-read the text, and thank you to the people who gave feedback on my writing as a whole.

Special thanks thus far to:
