# Chapter 1 – Clementine

Solana’s eyes weren’t amber yesterday.

Clementine remembered the first time she saw Solana’s eyes. It was a dry July evening in Firenze, and the sun had just touched the horizon.

As Clementine was returning home from the market that evening, a fire kitsune strayed onto her path. The kitsune limped on three paws, fur matted and caked in grime, and her eyes were dull, depleted coals. From her shabby appearance, she seemed like she would throw a fireball at Clementine and run away at any instant.

Yet, they were also the same eyes that would light up, brilliant, burning, and scarlet, against the evening rays, when Clementine tossed her a cured sausage. They were also the same eyes later that night that flitted nervously when Clementine washed, disinfected, and covered up her wounded paw. They were also the same eyes that softened as Clementine rinsed the dirt and shaved the mats out of her fur.

That was five-odd years ago. Every morning since, Solana had acted as Clementine’s alarm clock. Starting from Clementine’s bed, she would hop off and greet her with a light wave of her tails. Once she had come to the primary room, she would squint her warm, scarlet eyes at her in welcome.

Today was different. There was no morning ritual from Solana, no bright, fluffy face. Instead, Clementine had gotten out of bed alone, eyes wide, lips in a slight pout. Stepping into the primary room, she found Solana sitting in front of the main window.

She took note of Solana’s condition. Four paws tucked away neatly. Four tails folded together, pinched at the tips. Two ears pointed forwards. Fur, cream. Gaze, static. Eyes, amber.

_Amber_, not scarlet, as it had been.

---

Clementine knelt to Solana’s level. Solana stared blankly away and past the window, seemingly unaware of Clementine’s presence.

Clementine looked in the direction Solana was gazing. Her eyes landed around the window of a high-rise across the street. Planters with stray shoots of grass hung off the balcony railing, frost forming on the rim. A pigeon briefly landed on the railing, before it fluttered out of sight.

Clementine didn’t take Solana to be a bird-watcher, especially not one as serious as she had seemingly become this November morning.

She then looked again. Low, flat clouds cast a dull tint over the skyline. The odd vehicle rasped as it rolled across the surface of the road below. A trawler left a trail of white, frothy waves as it cut down the river. The air horn from a train bellowed in the distance.

She turned her gaze towards Solana. Solana’s gaze didn’t budge.

“Solana? Can you tell me what you’re looking at?”

Silence.

Clementine thought for a moment. She sat next to Solana, cross-legged, then placed her hand between Solana’s eyes and the window. Solana didn’t react. Then, she waved her hand vigorously. Solana still didn’t react.

Clementine frowned, then ruffled Solana’s head, between the ears. “What’s up with you today?” she murmured.

A childlike voice came from above her. “Solana’s been like that _all_ morning.”

Up high on a wall shelf was a carbuncle named Neko. He had found a patch of sun that had found its way past the clouds and glass, and sprawled out against it. His paws dangled off the edge, claws protracted, and his tail twitched idly. The gem on his head gleamed, casting emerald-green rays over the walls.

Once Clementine looked at him, Neko stretched, and like melting snow on a fresh spring day, slinked off the side of the shelf. He made a thump as he plopped onto the wood floor, followed by a series of smaller thumps as he bounced across the room and onto Clementine’s shoulder.

“I tried _everything_ to get her to play with me!” he whined.

Clementine rolled her shoulders and scratched Neko’s ear. “Is that right?” She replied.

“Ya-huh. I tried poking her everywhere. Her tails and her legs and her toes… her ears and her eyes and her nose.”

Clementine smiled, then scratched Neko’s head. “You’re always up for a playdate, aren’t you?” She could feel gentle vibrations from Neko as he purred.

“Well, I _guess_,” Neko said. “But, uhh, I’m also worried about her.” His eyes flitted down. “…Is she going to get better?”

Clementine’s smile waned.

She had seen something resembling Solana’s condition before. Once, she had been asked to help a man who had been enthralled and thought he was a tree, refusing to budge or accept any food or drink. Kitsune could tend to others’ minds well enough, and Solana was no different in that capacity. After her initial inspection, Solana simply stated that “he provoked a nymph”. It didn’t take long for her to attune herself to that man’s mind, uncover the source of the thrall, and purge it from his system.

If only Solana could tell her what she was afflicted with.

Clementine pursed her lips. “Well,” she said. “We know another kitsune who might be able to help, don’t we?”

Neko paused, and then his ears perked. “Oh yeah, we do! So are we going to visit the goldhorn’s grove? It smells really nice there!”

Clementine nodded. “I’ll get the backpack.”

She spent twelve minutes completing her morning routine—five minutes to shower, two minutes to don a winter coat and fleece-lined boots, two minutes to scarf down a fridge muffin, and three minutes to gear her backpack. A few notepad scribbles here, one carbuncle and his popcorn there, and she was at the front door.

When the doorknob clicked open, Solana’s ears swiveled. Before the door hinge could even squeak, Solana jumped onto her paws and bolted past Clementine, forcing her way through the gap and barrelling to the end of the floor. This was Solana—the kitsune who had practically turned into a statue overnight—and now she was running as though her life depended on it.

Clementine had barely a moment to register the development. “H-hey, wait?” she cried. “Solana?!” She stretched her hand out, only to snatch the empty air where Solana had been.

She bolted after her, Neko tumbling inside her backpack. “Woah!” he cried. “What’s happening out there?”

“It’s Solana,” Clementine said, panting. “She’s moving, and fast.”

Solana thrust her shoulder against the end door like a battering ram, flinging it open. She scurried down the stairwell level by level until she reached the ground floor.

Clementine knew that kitsune naturally outpaced humans, so it was futile to run her down. Still, if she could keep the gap narrow and tail Solana until she grew exhausted, perhaps she could catch up, eventually. Following Solana, Clementine swung over the handrail and slid down its edge.

Solana bashed the exit door open. A combination of pale, cloud-strained light and dry, frosty Firenze air swept past her and into Clementine’s face, making her squint.

Solana plowed on blindly. Her paws touched down on concrete, and she scrambled down the length of the sidewalk, pigeons flapping out of her way in a panic. She reached the next intersection. The signal across the pedestrian crossing was red and blinking. Solana stopped.

“That’s weird,” Clementine said, just loud enough for her passenger to hear.

“What is?” Neko replied.

“Solana—she just stopped at the crosswalk,” she said, words rushed. “Just a moment ago—she burst out of the apartment at full steam. Now—she’s just waiting at the walk signal.” She glanced up and down the cross street. “There aren’t even any cars around.”

“Huh, that’s one considerate thrall,” Neko replied. “Oh, maybe it’s a game, and she’s giving you a chance to catch up!”

Clementine was at the intersection. Solana stared ahead, still waiting for the turn signal to change. Clementine lunged for Solana, tightly wrapping her arms around her. “Solana—” she said, gasping. “Can you hear me now? Can you tell me where you’re going?”

“Yeah, we could really use your help in un-thralling you!” Neko said.

No response.

The pedestrian signal flashed green, and Solana jerked against Clementine’s arms. When Clementine refused to let go, Solana spun around and sunk her teeth into Clementine’s coat sleeve. Clementine gnashed her teeth, but she kept her grip.

A fireball bloomed in front of Clementine, courtesy of Solana. Clementine shielded her eyes with her arm—and right as she did so, Solana burst away and down the street.

The fireball evaporated. Clementine inspected the coat sleeve. The filling inside had been ripped out, but she saw no sign of bleeding. Solana was holding back.

Clementine looked up to see Solana already halfway down the next block. Taking a moment to breathe, Clementine pushed her legs onward and followed.

She wouldn’t lose her. She would make sure of that.
