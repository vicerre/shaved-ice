# Addendum

As I write, it's 2024-12-15â€”858 days since I originally posted the entries on this blog.

Since then, I can say that my other works have eclipsed this one. My other works collect an (admittedly meager) audience, while the only thing this work collects is dust.

This development presents an issue. Given the popularity of both works, people approach this work using prior knowledge of my other works. However, this work is designed as a standalone project, so prior knowledge will undermine the reader's expectations.

Knowing this, I must provide a disclaimer for readers familiar with my other works.

If you are a reader of my other works, then the following items apply to you:

- Some characters you encounter in this work bear similarities with those in my other works, and some bear drastic differences. Thus, if you assume certain traits of any given character, you will become confused and, potentially, disappointed. Instead, the best way to approach this story is to interpret it as an alternate universe retelling.
- Relatedly, the events that transpire in the story are considered canon to that of other material.
- Since I shared this story, my creative efforts have evolved. Compared to my newer writing, this story may come across as dated.
- If you encounter any questions when reading the story, write them down. If these questions are still relevant past the end of the story, ask them then.
