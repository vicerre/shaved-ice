Being a specialist in magical beasts has its perks. As a part of your work, you get to travel the world, studying a diverse range of creatures, each with their own unique temperaments, abilities, and needs. In addition, you're able to befriend these creatures, and some will join you as companions on your travels.

The downside to this life? You also act as the resident expert on supernatural phenomena, so it's also your job to resolve incidents as they arise.

When a phenomenon leaves her kitsune companion under a thrall, Clementine Monaghan sets out on a journey to restore her mental state. Along the way, she encounters a scientist by the name of Vicerre who, after an altercation, shunts Clementine into the Mental Plane. Now stuck in another world, she needs to return to the real world and restore her companions.

While in the Mental Plane, more questions arise: what is the source of this phenomenon, why did it start, and how can she stop it? To find the answers, Clementine needs to unravel the secrets of the Mental Planeâ€”and along with that, Vicerre.
