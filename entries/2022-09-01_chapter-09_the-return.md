# Chapter 9 – The Return

“Here,” Armin said. His voice was soft and low.

Clementine sat on a wrought-iron bench, one leg folded over the other. She stared at the ground, and she was breathing calmly. Her head was still whirling from the past few moments.

Armin sat next to her. His jacket had a large scorch mark over his left shoulder, and some of his hair had been singed.

He held a cup of tea in one hand, fingers arched around the lip. Steam wafted off the top of it.

Clementine slowly reached out for it and hugged it, its warmth spreading through her hands. She lifted the cup to her lips, took a small sip, and closed her eyes. It was sweet and minty, and it filled her mouth with warmth. She then took another sip, this one longer.

“So. Findings,” Armin said.

Clementine nodded towards him. “I’m ready.”

“Well, first things first.” He stretched his fingers out and stared at them. “This is a bit of a dreadful truth, now, isn’t it?”

---

He glanced at Clementine with a tired look. “All this time, we were trying to stop Vicerre, and it turns out that I’m derived from him?”

She slowly nodded. Her grip on the cup tightened. “So what does that mean for you?”

Armin’s eyes lingered at the top of the sky. The snowflakes continued to drift down, twirling and spinning around each other.

“I wish I had more answers,” he said. “Even if my appearance and permissions have reset, I still don’t have access to Vicerre’s memories.” He sighed slowly. “I still haven’t the faintest idea what Vicerre’s plan is for me.”

Clementine stared at the ground.

A gentle breeze drifted through the area.

“…Hey Armin,” Clementine said. “After you send me back, are you planning to send yourself back, too?”

He stared forward and gave a half-hearted smile. “If that’s what it takes to put an end to this phenomenon.”

“…Do you know if you’ll be fine?”

His eyes seemed to lose their luster. He turned aside and stared past her. “…You know the answer to that already, don’t you?”

He noticed that Clementine was staring straight into his eyes. He returned her gaze for a moment, then glanced away.

Moments later, he found Clementine holding his hands.

The flurries stopped.

The wind calmed.

Armin then took a deep sigh, then faintly smiled. “Right then. The nexus point should be restored now, so we can get you home.”

He stood up, pulling Clementine up with her.

Clementine looked towards Solana and Neko, and they walked up to the two.

Ice crystallized beneath the four, growing upwards and pushing them higher and higher. The light shined fiercely on them as they pushed past the wind and pulled away skywards. Clementine looked down. The world beneath them became smaller and smaller.

The ground beneath the ice rumbled. In the distance, Clementine saw the edges of the Headscape begin to fade.

“…Clem.”

She swiveled towards Armin.

“…When you reach the Physical Plane, will you do me a favor?”

Clementine looked at him with intent. “What is it?”

He thought for a moment, then returned her gaze. His expression was soft—tired, yet full of grace and acceptance.

“…Say ‘hi’ to Vicerre for me, will you?”

Before she could respond, she felt as though she were being torn apart again, each atom of her being separated from the other. She looked at her hand and saw it evaporate away—as did Armin. Yet, this sensation didn’t hurt at all. In its own way, it was almost pleasant.

She closed her eyes, and the world went black.
