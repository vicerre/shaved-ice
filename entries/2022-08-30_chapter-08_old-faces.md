# Chapter 8 – Old Faces

As the door opened, Clementine held her arm in front of her eyes. The rest of this world had been so dimly-lit that this part seemed blinding in contrast. As her eyes adjusted, she was able to view what was before her.

The new area had the same steel walls with fluorescent blue lights as before—yet these walls lacked the age and wear prior hallways had. It also seemed to lack the haphazard electrical sparks, spikes, and machinery as earlier.

Instead, the area looked as though it had evolved naturally over time. The terrain consisted of several rolling hills, covered in a blanket of soft, fresh snow. Conifers dotted the area, adding a spot of color to the otherwise monochrome landscape. The air smelled clean here, without a trace of iron. A few snowflakes drifted down lazily.

In the distance, Clementine noticed a few objects atop a hill. There was a grand, wrinkled pine at its peak. Cobblestone pavement surrounded the tree, winding from the top of the hill and around the terrain until it reached Clementine’s feet. A trio of wrought-iron benches, each with enough space for two, stood around the pine.

She looked up. Instead of a ceiling, the walls opened to a sky seemingly made of shattered glass, the normal vibrant blue stained with dissonant purple-gray flecks. At the sky’s zenith was a black, vacuous space, and instead of stars, electric blue lights leapt erratically from its core.

Armin’s gaze swiveled around the area, his eyes shifting from fixture to fixture. “I know this place,” he said. He then stared at the dark sky in silence.

Clementine stepped towards him and reached out. “Hey Armin… are you alright?” she asked. “If you want, we could—”

Armin spun towards Clementine. A few icicles shot up in her direction.

Clementine took a step back, breathing nervously.

Armin blinked twice, his tails sagged, and the icicles retracted.

He looked down. “…No, I’m not,” he said. He then paced back and forth, leaving claw marks in the snow.

“I’ve been seeking an answer to the changes to the Mental Plane,” he added. “It’s one thing to be able to traverse Vicerre’s Headscape and explore deeper into it. But it’s quite another to find evidence that he and I are acquainted. I’d never even _heard_ of Vicerre before I met you, so why does the evidence suggest otherwise?”

He paced in a circle for several moments.

He then stopped, and his tails sunk to the ground. He let out a hollow, sardonic chuckle.

“Of course,” he said. “…Why else wouldn’t we have seen any trace of him at this point?”

“Armin—” Clementine said. She suddenly paused and glanced down. The gears turned in her mind, and her eyes widened.

The air around Armin sharply chilled. Icicles pricked around him. “…Clementine,” he darkly said.

His gaze shuffled. “Sorry about this.”

A massive blast of cold air emanated from Armin, whipping Clementine’s hair back in a frenzy. Icicles grew from the ground in a circle around him, crawling slowly towards him.

Clementine immediately scrambled towards Armin, but a thick wall of ice, crystalline and frosted, shot out of the ground in front of her, causing her to stumble back. She sprinted around, eyes running up and down the wall, looking for any gap, only to find none.

She folded her hands into fists and pounded them against the ice. She struck the ice over and over, but it didn’t budge. She looked back at the other kitsune. “Solana—” she panted, “—can you—”

And then, the circle of icicles burst into the air. Bright red blood, fresh and wet, glistened against the crisp, clear ice. From what she could see through the frosted ice, Armin was still in the middle. Then the entire construction—walls, icicles, and blood—dissolved into diamond dust. The frost that had clung to her hair had vanished as well. Not even the scent of iron lingered in the air.

Armin was gone.

The ground beneath Clementine rocked back and forth. Snow sloughed off the trees and surrounding walls. Clementine was waiting for the ground to turn to quicksand, and—maybe—her eyes would open to see the green-painted walls of her bedroom, with Solana sitting over her blanket.

The tremors slowly faded away. Clementine tapped the stones beneath her feet, once, twice, then several times in a row. Solid. They were still in the Mental Plane.

Clementine panted slowly, in and out. She felt weak. Her eyes roved, looking for any hint that something had changed.

A small, furry thing bumped against her leg.

“Hey, uhm,” Neko said. “The real Armin is still okay… right?”

Clementine heaved a long, heavy sigh, then forced herself to nod.

---

The sky started to flash as though a thunderstorm was brewing. First, the sparks were dim and few, but they quickly grew in intensity and number, until the entire sky burned white. Clementine huddled against the ground and covered her eyes.

When she opened her eyes again, the light had subsided. The black, distorted void at the sky’s zenith was gone. Instead, for the first time in this world, a pale sun shone overhead.

Then, something fell from the sky. As it fell, it sparked and burned, leaving a silver trail as it did so. From the trajectory, it seemed it would land several hundred meters away from them.

The falling star crashed into a mound of snow some distance away in the parklet, landing with a loud thump and flinging chunks of snow around the impact area. From her location, Clementine could see a rough impression of what fell from the sky. It looked to be the same size and shape as an adult human.

Eventually, a person emerged from the impression. He looked tall and lanky, and he had wiry brown hair, and a long, pointed nose. He was dressed in a tweed jacket over a blue sweater, dress pants, and loafers. Snow coated his hair and shoulders.

Clementine’s breathing became tense. She took a step back, and her body rattled visibly.

Solana’s eyes narrowed. “That’s Vicerre, isn’t it?” she whispered.

Clementine nodded and hugged Solana’s side.

An array of fireballs bloomed behind Solana’s tails. “Just say ‘when’,” she said.

The person in the distance had started dusting the snow off his jacket, before he paused and stared at his hands. He peered over each digit and wiggled them playfully.

Clementine squinted curiously at him, holding her gaze tight.

Suddenly, a portal appeared next to her.

On the other side of the portal was the same man. From up close, Clementine could see that his facial features matched Vicerre’s. He had the same sunken-in, owl-like face and long pointed nose, but one thing was different: his eyes were a clear, bright blue.

He took a sharp breath, and his eyes scurried away from her.

“…Hi again,” he said.

The intonation of his voice resembled Vicerre’s, yet it had an airy lilt to it.

Solana bumped against Clementine’s side, her gaze intensely fixed on him.

“…Clem…?” he said.

Not ‘Miss Clementine’.

Clementine closed her eyes and drew her next breath slowly and surely. “…Please tell me that’s you, Armin…?”

The man lifted and dropped his shoulders. “I think so,” he said. “I would say with around… eighty percent certainty?”

A pane of ice slid up from the ground next to him, and he looked in its reflection, turning his head. “At least, the appearance is new.”

Clementine said, her tone measured, “You look just like Vicerre.”

His eyes flitted towards her for a moment, then glanced away. “…I figured that’s who this was.”

Clementine took a cautious step towards him, eyes wide. She then poked his nose, like a curious child prodding a wild animal. He looked at her with a scrunched, perplexed expression.

“Just checking that this isn’t an illusion,” she said.

She glanced aside and looked at the snow-covered hills.

After a moment, she added, “Well, you speak differently from him, and you can still make ice…”

“I’m much less fluffy than before, though.”

Clementine’s eyes widened, and she looked away, cheeks rosy. “Yep, much less fluffy.” She couldn’t imagine Vicerre saying anything like that.

She nudged Solana, and the fireballs surrounding them vanished. “So… you’re safe. You’re still in the Mental Plane, but you’re safe.”

Armin nodded curtly.

Clementine held her breath and marched through the portal. She tugged the lapels of his jacket and shook him like a rag doll.

“_What the heck?_” she said. “You don’t get to decide to kill yourself in front of your friends without any explanation.” Her face was the color of a tomato.

Armin looked genuinely bewildered. “I was—”

“And then you give me a heart attack by bringing me face to face with the guy who got me into this mess in the first place!”

“Well, _that_ part—”

Clementine gave a withering sigh, closed her eyes, and let go of him. “I’m just glad you’re alright.”

Armin glanced away from her and exhaled.

Snowflakes drifted lazily from the sky.

A moment later, Clementine turned towards Solana. “Hey,” she said to her, smiling tiredly. “…One fireball wouldn’t kill him, would it?”

Armin looked at her with an intrigued, if bemused expression.

Solana raised her head, and a fireball appeared above her, the size of an orange. She smiled with wry amusement. “Just say ‘when’.”

The bright yellow flames flickered in Armin’s eyes. Ice prickled around his feet, but shortly after, it subsided.

“You know what?” he said. “I’ll take it.”
