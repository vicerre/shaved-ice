# Chapter 10 – Revelations

Clementine’s eyes burst open.

Her body felt heavy. She was sitting, slumped, in a rigid, wooden chair. Her hair felt clammy. She started to move her head, but as she did so, something heavy atop it moved as well. She pulled an arm to touch it, but she found that her arm was fastened against one of the arms of the chair. As she looked at her arm, she noticed an IV needle stuck in it. The scent of antiseptic rose into her nostrils.

She looked down. She was still wearing fleece-lined boots—the same boots she had on before she entered the Mental Plane.

She looked around. The sky outside was dark, and the stray lights from neighboring windows did little to change the brightness. Inside, the only light came from a harsh, fluorescent bulb, casting cold, blue-gray rays around the room. She saw the same shelves of technical-looking equipment as before, and she saw her coat and backpack hanging on hooks by the entrance door. She didn’t see any trace of a kitsune or carbuncle nearby.

Instead, there was that lean, wiry-haired man in front of her. He was sitting with his legs folded, facing a desk with a monitor on it, data scrolling past it rapidly. His jacket was unburnt. The man didn’t flinch upon seeing her move about, or even glance at her.

After rocking back and forth a few more times, Clementine sighed heavily, then spoke up. “…Excuse me.”

The man sitting across from her slowly turned, staring at her with those intense, yellow eyes.

---

“Miss Clementine,” he said. “You managed to leave Oneiros.” His voice still had that cold and penetrating quality to it.

Clementine’s heart constricted, her muscles tensed, and her nerves pulsed. The readings on the monitor spiked. She instinctively jerked her hand, fighting against the straps.

In the next moment, a needle of ice, tapered at the tip, shot out of the ground beside her and stretched towards her face. It stopped just short of touching her—if she sneezed too hard, she would have impaled her eye.

She knew that ability all too well by now. When she had seen Armin use the ability, it was used to travel the Mental Plane. Now, Vicerre had warped it beyond its purpose. A cold realization dawned on her that she had been imprisoned by someone who was once her friend—possibly with her life at stake. A knot formed in her stomach, and a dreadful chill crawled down her spine.

Vicerre’s eyes scanned Clementine’s periphery before locking in on her. “Please return,” he declared.

Clementine stayed stiffly upright, pinned in place by the threat of the icicle looming in front of her.. Her breath was short and cautious. Looking at him, she said, “Can we talk? Please?”

He tilted his head. “Considering your current position, that’s a bold demand, isn’t it?”

The icicle slid towards her, brushing against an eyelid.

Clementine gritted her teeth, and her hands formed into fists. “Dang it, Armin,” she muttered, “I could really use your help right now.”

Vicerre cocked his head in response. The icicle stayed firmly in place, prickling, as if it were itching to strike her. “Armin?” He echoed. “You’re holding onto the idea that the figment you saw in the Mental Plane was anything but an illusion?”

He scoffed. “Miss Clementine, he was a thought experiment—a fabrication. He acted as your guide to the Mental Plane and as one of those ‘companions’ you desired so much. He provided a bevy of data for my research, certainly, but to call him ‘real’ is a delusion on your behalf.”

Clementine’s eyebrows twitched. “Then why did he—”

“Why did he act against me and release you from Oneiros?”

He said, his voice cold, “He told you what you wanted to hear. He played his part. And thanks to you, his role as a failsafe against Oneiros has been addressed accordingly.”

He continued, “Following that, Miss Clementine, your presence is no longer necessary.”

Clementine glared at the icicle, trying to push through the fear that was settling into her bones. Her heart pounded out of her chest, and her lungs screamed. She squeezed her eyes shut and took a deep breath. “I don’t believe you,” she quietly said.

A thin, puzzled smile grew on Vicerre’s face.

“…Listen,” she said. “You don’t have to explain anything to me. I don’t doubt that you have your reasons for doing what you do. If you want, you can finish driving that icicle into my brain. …Am I scared out of my mind over that? _Hell, yes._”

Her lungs felt heavy, and she quickly continued. “But if you designed Oneiros for the reason I think you did, it won’t help you resolve what you’re going through.”

Vicerre leaned back in his seat, then uncrossed his legs and approached her. His cold, intense stare met her own. “And pray tell, Miss Clementine, how did you arrive at that conclusion?”

Clementine sank into the chair and took a deep, shuddering breath. “W-well… in your Headscape, there was a terminal with some files on it.” She glanced down. “Armin and I learned how to escape from Oneiros from one of them.”

Vicerre leaned in towards Clementine. His gaze was fixed intensely on her, waiting to pounce on her next word. She kept her gaze locked on his.

“…But that’s not all,” she said.

Vicerre slowly tilted his head.

She gulped and looked down. “There were other files. Logs. Written by you. They told the story of your life before all this—your past research on the Mental Plane, the project’s development, and… the accident.”

She blinked. “The real Armin. The one you originally knew. He died then, didn’t he?”

Vicerre remained silent, his expression inscrutable. The icicle wavered for a moment.

“…I’m sorry about what happened to him,” she said, her head hanging low. “If Solana died, I wouldn’t know _what_ I’d do.”

Vicerre’s countenance faltered for a brief moment before he collected himself. “…You are a very curious person,” he said.

She could feel the icicle slowly thawing, and her breathing began to relax. Clementine forced herself to smile.

Her lips parted, and she glanced back at Vicerre. “Oneiros,” she said. “If everything went as planned, our minds would have been permanently linked to the Mental Plane, and our physical bodies would have taken care of themselves, right?”

Vicerre tilted his head down, his gaze hardened and his expression impassive. He calmly replied, “It would be a world without suffering or heartache, Miss Clementine—one where your physical needs would be met and the consequences of this domain would be spared.”

He continued, “—Tell me, Miss Clementine, would you throw away your time as recklessly as you do now, knowing that one day, the ones you care so much about may be gone forever? With Oneiros, you would have no excuse for not offering them an alternative solution.”

He pulled back and pressed his fingers against the pits of his cheeks, his gaze askew. “Or… you could deny them that chance, and after they die, you live each day with the regret that you had the chance to save them, yet chose not to.”

Clementine stared back at him. Her lungs tightened. A bead of sweat ran down the side of her head.

“Look. Vicerre,” she said. “…Don’t get me wrong. While I was in Oneiros, I had a nice time. I enjoyed taking on the next adventure ahead of us, meeting with old friends, and…” Her eyes relaxed. “...Making new friends.”

She broke eye contact with him and smiled tiredly. “Considering how it turned out, it was fun. So… thank you, Vic. I’m glad I had the chance to try it out. And—” she blinked quickly “—who knows—under better circumstances, I might have enjoyed Oneiros longer.”

Vicerre stared at her, then exhaled dryly, waiting for her to continue.

She looked at him with a pained expression. “Despite all of that, though, you’re still suffering, aren’t you? …You’re terrified of losing someone you care about again. That’s why you push others away. That’s why you seek control. And that’s why you spent so much time on Oneiros—to distract yourself from those feelings. And in doing so, you’re burning yourself trying to keep this dream of yours alive.”

For a fleeting moment, she could see Vicerre’s eyelids twitch.

Clementine’s eyes opened slightly wider, and then she looked away. “…Even if the Armin I knew wasn’t real, his personality had to come from a real place, didn’t it? In the end, he still cared about you. He wanted to see you happy. And because of that, he was content to give up his existence, for _your_ sake. Just because he was a ‘fabrication’ didn’t mean that his actions were meaningless. I considered him a friend. …And so, by extension, I consider you one, too.”

Her head hung down, and her eyes pinched shut. “If you want to keep your guard up, you can. If you want to send me back to the Mental Plane, you can. If you want to kill me…” She pursed her lips. “…Well, I don’t really have a choice, right? All I can do from here is share what I think, and the rest is your call.”

Vicerre drew a deep, drawn-out sigh.

When Clementine opened her eyes, she saw that he had turned aside from her and stared at an empty spot against the wall.

The icicle receded.

One moment later, Clementine felt a shuffling motion from the device on her head, and she could feel her hair being tugged. Slowly, the weight on her head had lifted, and Clementine’s shoulder rose.

Vicerre left for another room for a brief moment, then returned. He knelt to Clementine’s level, slipped the IV needle out of her forearm, placed it aside in a small tray on a table behind her, and applied a bandage with cotton stuck to the underside. From there, he loosened the straps around her arms, and then her torso and legs. Clementine could now move about.

Vicerre then grasped Clementine’s hand, turned it over, unfolded it, and placed something in it.

It was her folding knife.

Clementine’s eyes widened. Her hand quivered, and she slowly turned towards Vicerre.

“…Why are you giving me this?” she asked.

A moment of silence passed, and Vicerre then spoke up. “It’s yours,” he simply said, shrugging. “I’m simply returning things to what they were.”

Clementine stared at the knife, then looked back at Vicerre, blinking.

She slowly closed her hand around the knife’s handle. Then, with force, she threw it against the floor. The knife made a hollow rattling sound as it dug blade-first into the floorboards.

She then steadied herself and marched up to Vicerre. She pulled her arms around him, squeezing him tight.

Vicerre recoiled stiffly, shuffling in her grasp. “Clementine…” he murmured.

Not ‘Miss Clementine’.

“…It’s not exactly wise to show affection towards the person who nearly lobotomized you,” he muttered.

Clementine held onto him. “…Yeah, probably,” she replied. “But I think you need it.”

She could feel as the tension in Vicerre’s body slowly eased. Vicerre huffed.

A moment later, he tapped Clementine’s shoulder, then pointed his nose towards the entrance. “The exit is over there,” he said. “Solana and Neko should be with you shortly.”

Clementine blinked repeatedly, looking blankly towards Vicerre.

“…You’re free to leave, you know,” he said.

Clementine suddenly unfolded her arms and held them in the air. “Oh! I mean…” Her gaze danced across the room, looking at every device within sight. “It’s not like I don’t want to leave, but…” She looked back at him. She quietly said, “I just can’t leave you like this, you know?”

Vicerre tossed Clementine a noncommittal shrug, then lightly smiled. “I’ll be fine,” he said.

Clementine stared at him. He stared back. She nodded.

Without any additional words, she began to walk towards the exit. She looked at the door, then back at him. Vicerre nodded.

At the door, Clementine unhooked her coat and backpack, donned them, then stepped into the hallway.

She turned her head back, glancing at Vicerre.

She waved at him.

He waved back.
