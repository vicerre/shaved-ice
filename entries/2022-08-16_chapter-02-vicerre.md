# Chapter 2 – Vicerre

Clementine’s eyes wandered about the building in front of them.

“Did we catch her?” Neko asked.

“…Kind of,” she replied. “We’re outside… another apartment complex?”

She was standing outside a building several stories tall. The walls were covered in stucco siding the color of ivory, faded, chipped, and peeling, and the roof was covered with rows of terracotta tiles. The worn, wooden front door contrasted sharply with the iron call box that hung outside it. A sign above the call box gave the address as 680 49th Street. Stray shoots of grass pierced the concrete tile path leading to the door.

In front of the door was Solana, sitting patiently.

Clementine came up to her and heaved her into her arms. Almost immediately, Solana spilled back onto the ground and waited in front of the door.

Clementine scratched her head and looked at the entrance door. “So… I guess we’re visiting a stranger?”

“I’ll say hi to them!” Neko said.

Clementine gripped the doorknob firmly, then turned. The latch clicked open.

Clementine flinched; she didn’t expect the main entrance to open without a key. Looking ahead and pinching her lips, she slowly pushed open the door.

As soon as she did, Solana squeezed through the opening. One moment later, she was in front of the elevator, having pressed the ‘up’ button. As the elevator descended to ground level, Clementine idly strolled in behind Solana. Once the doors opened, Solana entered and pressed the button for the fourth floor. Clementine followed, and the door closed.

Inside, Solana sat with her head aimed out the door.

The elevator rose. One corner of Clementine’s lips tightened, and her shoulders tensed.

“This is pretty strange, isn’t it?” she asked Neko.

“Yeah, our adventure is taking us up an elevator.”

---

“That too! But I mean, whatever force that enthralled Solana doesn’t seem to care that I’m following her, does it? We’re not considered enemies, nor have we been enthralled already. It’s like… we’re being invited to whatever lies ahead.”

“I hope it’s a surprise birthday party,” Neko replied. “With fish and ice cream.”

The elevator dinged, and the doors slid open.

The fourth floor looked domestic enough. The hallway was lined with flaky, ivory plaster. Decorative cornices butted the floor and ceiling. Warm, yellow lighting traveled from end to end. Apartment doors punctuated its length.

Solana wandered up to door 403, and Clementine followed. Solana sat in front of this door, too.

Clementine looked down the ends of the hallway. She exhaled quietly, then pressed her ears against the door.

A faint, mechanical hum came from the other side. Then, the sound of creaking against wood. Then another, then another. Footsteps. Clementine sighed.

Magical creatures were predictable—their behaviors could be studied, recorded, and saved in a single compendium. She could guess when Neko would get hungry and beg Clementine to find a snack. She could guess that he would want the most exotic option on the menu. And she could count down to the number of seconds his tail would twitch after taking the first bite. On the other hand, humans were different beasts altogether. Twenty-odd years of interacting with them, and she still never found a solution that worked every time—nor would she ever in her lifetime, she figured.

Before Clementine could react, the door clicked and swung open.

On the other side of the door was a man. He was wearing a tweed jacket over a woolen blue sweater, dress pants, and loafers. He had wiry, brown hair, a tall, sharp nose, and a gaunt figure. He was several centimeters taller than her and several years her senior.

Then she noticed the man’s eyes. They were round and sunken into the skull cavity, giving him an owl-like quality. His irises were stained an unusual shade of yellow… the exact same jaundice that Solana had. Suddenly, Clementine felt as though her mind had been snagged on tenterhooks.

The man glanced at Solana. Then, his eyes ran up and down Clementine. His head turned slightly askew as he asked, “…And who might you be?” His voice was as though it was on the precipice of a snarl. Clementine breathed in sharply, and her skin crawled.

“…Sorry to bother you,” she muttered. “I’m Clementine Monaghan.” She rolled her shoulders, rustling the backpack.

Neko poked his head out of her backpack. “Hello! My name is Neko.” He purred and squinted warmly. “It’s very nice to meet you, mister…?”

The man’s gaze shifted towards the carbuncle. “Vicerre,” he said.

Vicerre’s gaze returned to Clementine, who flinched in response. Clementine pointed to Solana, who squirreled her way inside. “That kitsune—”

“You are its owner, I take it?” he said.

Clementine jerked up and ran her fingers through her hair. “Well…” she fumbled, “I’m more of a—”

Without deigning to hear the rest of the response, he swung the door shut.

Clementine stood in shock for a moment, then frantically clasped the doorknob and twisted. It moved under her torque, though not without resistance. She wrested the doorknob with both hands, then pushed herself against the face of the door.

From the other side, Vicerre glowered at her. “Miss Clementine, know that I am a very busy person, and I certainly do not have the time to accommodate unexpected guests,” he said. “I request that you leave.”

Clementine took a deep breath. “ —Look,” she said, “Solana is in there. You have the same, weird yellow eyes as her. She’s a statue, you’re not. Can you tell me what’s happening with both of you? Please? Maybe it’s something I can help you with?”

Vicerre thought for a second, then pushed the door back harder.

Clementine breathed sharply; she was hoping diplomacy would have worked here.

She then heaved, and, with all of her weight, slammed her body forward. The door flung open, hurling Vicerre against the side wall. Clementine stumbled and fell face-to-face with the floorboards. Dust blew up and away from her, and she coughed.

“Are you okay?!” Neko cried.

It took a moment for the daze to clear. Eventually, she grunted, “…Yeah. How about you?”

“Peachy.”

Peeking out of the backpack, Neko then surveyed the area. “Huh, it smells funny in here,” he said. “Are we sure this is an apartment?”

Clementine whipped her head up.

---

The inside of Vicerre’s apartment could have hardly been called a standard living space.

One wall was lined with shelves upon shelves of technical-looking equipment. There was a shelf for small, plastic bottles containing chemical solutions, another for small electronics—the kind with buttons and/or switches, analog displays, and integrated circuits—and yet another for casings, clamps, and other foundational parts. This continued to the other end of the room.

Additional shelves occupied the middle of the room, on which mechanisms were sorted tidily into bins labeled PO-0.0.1, PO-0.0.2, and such, up to 0.3.5. The size of each device roughly correlated with the digits on the label, with the smallest fitting between two fingers, and the largest requiring both arms to carry. Clementine counted 14 such bins before she gave up.

Besides a dirty, uneven window, there was a broad work desk with a matching office chair. A monitor sat in front of the window, displaying many technical-looking diagrams. Many were labeled with descriptors and numbers, though some appeared incomplete. Elsewhere on the desk lay a collection of industrial-looking hardware arranged in discrete clusters. Some looked to be individual components, while others appeared to be assemblages of other components. Clementine didn’t recognize what any of the devices were meant to be.

One corner of the room, approximately three meters in width, was cordoned off with tape. Inside was a corner table on which a dome-shaped device sat. It was roughly a quarter of a meter in diameter, steel gray, and had a mesh of wires across its surface. It was connected to a large, steel tower nearby, dotted with an array of blinking lights.

Most importantly, Solana had found her way there. Like a sentinel, she was transfixed by the dome-shaped device. Clementine’s teeth clenched.

“Miss Clementine,” said Vicerre. He had staggered onto his feet and looked at her tiredly. “…You really shouldn’t barge into someone’s personal quarters. I do not need anyone sullying my workspace—much less a complete stranger such as yourself.”

Clementine ignored him and marched over to the cordoned-off area. Solana was still staring at the dome-shaped device. Clementine pushed the dome toward the edge of the table. Solana’s eyes followed.

Clementine lifted the dome in the air. Solana’s gaze followed.

Clementine set the dome back down. Solana’s gaze followed again. Clementine’s eyes narrowed.

She traced the wires back to the black tower. The tower seemed to be feeding the device power.

“Hey Neko,” Clementine said. “Can you pass me the folding knife?”

Vicerre’s head tilted.

Neko’s tail perked up. “The folding knife? Yep, one moment!” He disappeared into the backpack. “Folding knife, folding knife…”

“It’s roughly the same size and shape as a pickle.”

The sound of scrounging could be heard from inside the backpack. Moments later, Neko cried, “Ah! Got it.” He resurfaced, the folding knife in his mouth.

Clementine smiled at him. “Thank you.”

As Clementine reached out for the knife, Neko’s jaw suddenly hung loose, the knife clattering to the floor. Neko’s whole body convulsed, causing him to slump out of the backpack and collapse onto the boards.

“Neko?!” Clementine’s eyes grew wide.

Clementine dropped the backpack and spun towards Neko. His limbs had contorted in four different directions, and his tail was twitching erratically. The rims of Neko’s irises were yellow, and like ink in water, the yellow tint was spreading.

Clementine’s mouth hung open. She slowly pulled her head back and shook her head.

Her eyes jumped from the device, then to its connecting cables, then to the knife on the ground. She scrambled for the knife, then, grasping with her spare hand, pulled the cables taut.

“Miss Clementine.”

Vicerre.

“…Do you honestly think I’d let you put your hands over my property if you had any chance of finding what you’re looking for?”

Clementine halted.

Vicerre tapped the door and pointed his nose through the opening. “You should really get going before you make any more decisions you will come to regret.”

Clementine’s nostrils flared, and she shot a glare at Vicerre.

She sheathed and holstered the knife in the outer right pocket, slung the backpack over her shoulders, and took several steps towards the exit. As she did so, she kept her eyes on Vicerre.

Then, she made her move. In a second, she snatched the folding knife and shoved Vicerre against the wall with her free forearm, hard enough to make the door rattle. Flicking the blade open, she pointed it towards his throat.

“Look,” she said. “I don’t know what this is all about. Maybe you’re enthralled as well, maybe you’re the enthraller. —But I’m not leaving my friends behind.” She glanced down. “Whatever it takes.”

Looking at the blade, Vicerre blinked twice in quick succession. He then sharply exhaled. “Is that so? In that case, I won’t deny that I am the ‘enthraller’, as you put it,” he casually replied. “And I won’t deny that killing me will liberate your pets.”

Clementine’s eyes widened, and she advanced the knife closer. It was now centimeters away from contact.

“In that case, give me my friends back,” she demanded, voice trembling.

Vicerre looked curious. “If I understand you correctly… you’re threatening a person’s life—one you’ve met moments ago—” His head dipped. “To liberate your pets.”

Clementine’s lungs were tight. The knife rattled in her hand. “Stop calling them pets,” she said. “They’re much more than that.”

His face crept into a disquieting grin. “You don’t deny that you’re willing to kill to get them back. …Are you _that_ desperate for friendship?”

Clementine merely scowled in response.

Vicerre scoffed. “Well, in that case… go on.”

Clementine blinked. “Go… on?”

“Kill me.”

She shook her head. “What do you mean?”

“You’ve shown initiative, and I refuse to surrender your pets—” Clementine twitched. “—so… kill me. Liberate them. Return to your life.”

Clementine lowered the knife slightly. “You’re up to something.”

He gestured modestly. “Well, that much is obvious. Regardless of what my plans are, however, you don’t have any choice in the matter, do you? After all, you refuse to leave empty-handed.”

Clementine stared at him in thought.

“So, Miss Clementine, what will you do?”

She stayed silent.

Vicerre waited for Clementine’s response. She kept quiet, but her expression spoke volumes.

Vicerre’s head slowly tilted. “…Neither option is favorable for you, so the only thing you can do is to burn time and pray that I miscalculate between now and the time one of us drops.”

Clementine huffed.

“Very well, then. If you won’t come to a decision, I suppose I’ll make that decision for you.”

Clementine broke her expression and blinked. “What?”

With a single index finger, Vicerre pushed the broad of the knife away from him. Then, he slowly unfurled Clementine’s grip around the handle, and the knife clattered to the ground.

Clementine stared at her hand. She attempted to pick up the knife again, but her hand would not respond. She then tried to grip Vicerre’s throat, but she found that she could not move. She cursed under her breath.

Vicerre kicked the knife to the edge of the room, cracked his neck, straightened his jacket, and walked away from Clementine. He returned to the main room and leaned against the work table, back against the sun-lit window.

He turned to face Clementine. His gaze fell in her direction, yet it traveled past her, uninterested. “Well then, Miss Clementine. You’ve insisted on staying here for your pets. You also want to understand my project and how it connects me to them. Judging by your actions just now, you’ve shown yourself to be an excellent candidate for its trial run.” He looked away. “And, quite frankly, I don’t have any other choice.”

“So,” he said. “Let’s begin.”
