# Chapter 7 – Inner Space

“I found something.”

Solana looked up from a game board. It had been what felt like an hour and a half, and a portal had opened at the entrance of the Headscape.

Neko shot up and flopped down on the game board. Several wooden tiles flew into the air and scattered around him. He sat back up, shook himself, and looked into the portal. “Is that you, Mister Armin?”

“Quite!” Armin replied. “Well, come along, whenever you’re ready. Fair warning, though—it’s not exactly the most exciting of discoveries.”

Clementine had been studying the logs on the console when she walked into the portal. She was now wearing a thick, puffy jacket, earmuffs, and a beanie.

She inspected Armin. His snow-white fur was as pristine as ever, and his eyes were clear, bright blue. Her eyes traveled around his figure, looking for any red stains or skin discolorations, but she couldn’t find any. While Armin was traversing the maze, she wanted to share something with him, now that he was in front of her, though, the words wouldn’t come to her.

She wiped her hand over her face, hiding her expression. “Thank goodness you’re back,” she said. “I was getting worried something bad had happened to you.”

The area on the other side looked dilapidated. The walls were consumed by roots stemming from beyond the door, and there were gaps in the siding, through which a bitter, frigid wind howled.

There was a large, wired door in front of them, with the same design as the one at the entrance. There was a terminal and keyboard in front of this one as well. The barbed wire around the handle was thoroughly rusty.

Next to the door was a small hole, roughly five centimeters in diameter. It reached far into the wall, and ice had been pushed into it.

“There’s a switch to activate the terminal in there,” Armin commented, pointing. “If you had used your hand, it would have been mangled beyond recognition.”

Clementine winced vicariously. “Good thing you have ice for that.”

He nodded curtly.

“All right, let’s see what we’ve got here.” Clementine looked at the terminal.

    > [PROJECT ONEIROS]
    > Password: admin
    > Unlocked.

    > Turn one down into three across for his name (5)
    > Password 2: █

Clementine scanned the new line on the screen—then scanned it again. She muttered the text to herself. Then, she started typing.

    > Turn one down into three across for his name (5)
    > Password 2: help
    > Wrong password.

Clementine blew air out her mouth and teased her hair.

She tried all of the basic password options from previously, but they all displayed “Wrong password.” when submitted. She also gave a halfhearted tug at the exposed parts of the wall, but they refused to budge.

She sighed. “I guess we actually need to solve this one, huh?”

Armin nodded firmly.

Clementine squeezed her chin. “Well,” she said. “‘One down’ and ‘three across’ sound like puzzle words. I used to solve puzzles with ‘across’ and ‘down’ clues back in high school. And if that’s the case, then the ‘5’ in parentheses must be the length of the word.”

She looked down at the keyboard. “I guess it’s not _impossible_ to try every five-letter word until we find the right one.”

“It is a valid problem-solving strategy,” Armin commented, staring away from her.

Solana said, “There must surely be a way we can narrow down the range of words we must attempt.”

Clementine reviewed the password prompt, and she idly tapped her fingers on the keyboard. “From how I’m reading it,” she said, “It’s looking for a name.” Her eyes suddenly went wide, and her fingers clenched.

Neko tilted his head and waved his tail. “Hmmm, ‘Vicerre’ doesn’t fit into five letters, does it? Unless he spells his name weird,” he grumbled.

Solana looked at Armin with a quiet, mild gaze. “We only know of him as ‘Vicerre’,” she said. “However, humans usually have more than one alias. As an example, ‘Clementine’ is also known as ‘Monaghan’.”

Clementine bit her lips. “I don’t think he would use his own name as a password.”

“You say that after we discovered the password to the first terminal,” she replied. “Why do you believe this not to be the case here?”

“I just don’t,” she insisted.

Solana looked at Clementine firmly, then tossed her tails. “Very well. We will not seek out Vicerre’s other names.”

A moment later, Armin said, “You might be onto something, though.”

Solana looked at him in anticipation.

“Reset the terminal,” he told Clementine. Clementine pressed a series of buttons, and the following text displayed on the screen again.

    > [PROJECT ONEIROS]
    > Password: admin
    > Unlocked.

    > Turn one down into three across for his name (5)
    > Password 2: █

“The previous password is displayed visibly here. What reason would there be to keep the last password visible, unless it were part of the puzzle?”

A moment later, Neko’s eyes flashed. “Hey, hey,” he said. “Mister Armin! How do you spell your name?”

Armin stared at Neko and tilted his head. He opened his mouth, but then he paused, tails frozen. He glanced around, and his tails began coiling and writhing, as if they had a mind of their own.

Clementine slowly said, “…It’s spelled just like how it’s pronounced, isn’t it? A-R-M-I-N?” It was five letters long. She stared at the terminal, fingers resting on the keyboard, keys unpressed.

Neko’s tail swished. “That’s one letter away from ‘admin’! And that’s a name. Maybe you’re the admin of this world and you don’t know it. Or maybe you were the admin, but now you are-n’t?”

Solana raised her head, eyes slowly widening. “The first letter of ‘down’ becomes the third letter of ‘across’.”

A chill emanated from him and pierced Clementine. Neko shuddered.

Clementine took a step towards Armin. “It’s just an idea,” she said, shaking her head. “We don’t have to—”

“No,” he snapped, voice low. “Type it in.”

Clementine’s heart leapt, and she took a step back from him. “Okay,” she said softly.

    > Turn one down into three across for his name (5)
    > Password 2: armin

She tightened her fingers, refusing to press the next button. Her eyelids sagged as she looked at Armin.

He looked back at her, eyes filled with grave intensity. Then, without another word, he extended ice over the keyboard and tapped the button himself.

The sound of motors turning and pins clicking rang from behind the exterior. The floor vibrated. As the door shook, light spilled through an opening.

A moment later, everything was quiet again.

There was now new text on the monitor.

    > Welcome back.
