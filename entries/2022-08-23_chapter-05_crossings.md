# Chapter 5 – Crossings

Clementine spun around.

A market plaza stretched before her eyes. Wooden stalls lined the edge of the plaza, vendors beckoning the crowd towards their wares. Behind them were additional specialty stores. Crowds of ephemeral customers flowed from vendor to vendor, chatting among themselves and taking their sundries with them. The sky in this place was a warm, deep violet, the lamps hanging off the storefronts giving the square a cozy atmosphere. The smell of baked goods and roasted meat wafted through the air. A church bell rang in the distance.

Then, Clementine’s eyes converged on one figure amidst the crowd. Her eyelids grew wide, and her heart raced.

Next to a gelato vendor was a kitsune and carbuncle pair. The kitsune had cream fur and four tails, and the carbuncle had a green gem and was gobbling up a spilled pink gelato. She needed a second. She needed a second to confirm her thoughts, however; both of their pelts were unkempt, and the kitsune’s paws were lined with a burgundy color. She sighed in relief when she noticed their eyes were normal.

As if she were urged on by the wind, she weaved through the crowd up towards the pair. Moments later, she was within arm’s reach of them. She heaved a ragged sigh, and her shoulders slumped.

“…You’re here,” she said.

“Hi, Clem!” Neko replied, tail idly wiggling. “Nice Mental Plane outfit!”

Clementine smiled weakly at him, then swung her arms around them both. Solana closed her eyes, and Neko rubbed his head against Clementine and purred.

Letting them go, Clementine cried, “You look like you’ve been in battle! Are you okay? What hurt you?”

Solana bowed gently. “Even if we have been scuffed, we are no worse for wear,” she said. “I’m glad that we were able to meet, and I’m glad that you are well.”

She looked over at the icy kitsune coming up behind them. “You made another friend, I see?” Her tone was that of dry amusement.

Clementine nodded. “This is Armin,” she said, gesturing to him.

Armin fanned his tails out and bowed. “Hello,” he said. He pointed to the kitsune. “Solana.” Then to the carbuncle. “Neko.” Then to Clementine. “She’s told me about you.”

Solana bowed back and unfurled hers in return. She looked at him with a squint. “Armin, is it? I am pleased to make your acquaintance.”

She looked from Armin to Clementine. “We must catch up,” she said. “I have news to share about the state of the Mental Plane.”

Clementine nodded sternly.

Neko added, “Do you want some ice cream while we’re at it? Food is free in this world.”

Armin blinked. “Ice cream?”

“Oh, hmm, have you never had ice cream before? It’s a snack that’s soft and cold and sweet!”

“Aha, I know what ice cream is,” he replied. “It’s just… why now?”

Neko looked at Armin. “Ice kitsune, ice _cream_,” he said, in a self-evident, matter-of-fact tone.

Armin looked helplessly at Clementine.

She stifled a giggle and ruffled Armin’s head. “Well… I can’t say that he’s wrong.”

The four of them had found an empty table on a quiet side street. Clementine sat in one chair, and Armin took the seat across from her. Solana and Neko had rinsed themselves at a fountain and were now sitting on the cobblestone paving. Each had an acrylic dessert bowl in front of them, with scoops of pink gelato inside, sweet and fragrant—or a cleaned-out bowl, in Neko’s case.

Clementine played with her spoon and looked at Solana. “You were enthralled before any of us,” she said. “What happened?”

Solana tucked her tails away, then looked at her. “At first, it was a normal dream. I was exploring the countryside and enjoying the stars in the evening sky. But then… _something_ broke in. I can tell when other dreamwalkers are nearby when exploring, but this wasn’t a dreamwalker.”

Clementine took a bite. “Go on.”

Solana thought for a moment. “It had an unnatural aura to it. It reminded me of a swarm of bugs that skittered, stung, and bit at the dream. I didn’t understand what it was doing at first, but I found that I couldn’t wake up.”

She continued. “Later, I sensed it doing something else. It ate away at parts of the dream, but it was also replacing those parts with new parts.”

“…Is that good or bad?” Clementine asked.

Solana looked up. “Take a look at this Headscape,” she said. “Do you notice anything unusual about it?”

Now that Clementine thought about it, she hadn’t been focusing on her surroundings.

She looked at the building next to them: parts of the roof were constructed of sloped, curved wood, while other parts were carved from stone and intricately crenelated. The sign on the front seemed to indicate that this place sold designer clothing and sushi. She didn’t think that combination made sense together.

Her eyes traveled down the street, looking at the ephemeral figures that populated this Headscape. Some of these figures were dressed in outfits she only saw in history museums—hand-stitched and simply dyed. Others wore clothes that would not stand out from modern fashion. Yet others wore clothes that looked like a jumble of both.

“Oh,” she said. “I assumed that was a normal part of the dream.”

“These elements are from Neko’s Headscape,” Solana explained. “And likewise, this is also how Neko found me.”

“So not only is it crossing dreamers with each other, but it’s able to tamper with their Headscapes directly,” Armin mused. “It’s not a coincidence that the earliest to be affected were kitsune, was it? Our sensitivity to the Mental Plane makes us easy targets.”

Solana looked at Armin and narrowed her eyes. “That is a plausible explanation,” she replied. “Yet if so, we still do not understand the purpose behind these events.”

“Maybe someone really wants us to try the free food here,” Neko said. He had dug into Solana’s bowl.

Solana looked at Clementine. “We do have a lead on this question, however. Neko and I found a world connected to ours that seems to have answers.”

Neko said, “Well, _kind_ of. We know the name of the thing.”

Clementine blinked. “You found a name?”

Solana nodded. “The world included a reference to something called… Project Oneiros.”

Armin’s ears swiveled at the term. His mouth was caked in ice cream.

Clementine played with her spoon. “That’s ‘oneiro-’ as in ‘the study of dreams’, right?”

Solana nodded.

Clementine leaned in towards Solana. “That must be Vicerre’s Headscape. What else did you find?”

Solana glanced at Neko. “That’s the farthest we could get. The rest of the information was behind locked doors.”

“Locked doors you say,” Armin said. “I don’t suppose we could take a second look at them?”

“Of course,” Solana replied.

“Hey Mister Armin?” Neko added.

“Yes, Neko?” he asked.

“…Are you going to finish your ice cream?”
